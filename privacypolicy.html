    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Effective date: January 2, 2026</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Lucid Tree ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our macOS application Lucid Tree (the "App"). If you do not agree with the practices described here, please do not use the App.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect only the information needed to provide and improve the App. This may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>App Usage Data:</strong> anonymous analytics and crash reports to help us improve stability and features. These reports do not contain your file contents.</li>
      <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> basic device metadata such as OS version, device model, and locale.</li>
      <li><strong>User-Provided Information:</strong> contact information you provide when you email support or opt-in to feedback.</li>
      <li><strong>Local Data:</strong> the App may read file and folder metadata from your local disk to display the visual hierarchy; file contents remain on your device unless you explicitly share them with us.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>We use collected information to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide, operate, and maintain the App.</li>
      <li>Diagnose and fix issues through crash reports and logs.</li>
      <li>Understand usage patterns and improve features.</li>
      <li>Respond to your support requests and messages.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Local-First Design</h2>
    <p>Lucid Tree is designed to be local-first. All file indexing and analysis occur on your Mac. We do not upload file contents, directory trees, or personal files to our servers by default. If you choose to share logs or reports with us (for example, when requesting support), you explicitly consent to that upload.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We may use third-party services for analytics, crash reporting, and distribution. These services may collect anonymous usage information. Examples include crash reporters and analytics SDKs. We choose providers that limit collection to operational data and avoid file contents.</p>

    <h2>5. Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may disclose information when required by law, to protect our rights, or with your consent (for example, when you submit a support request and include logs).</p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain collected information only as long as necessary to provide and improve the App or to comply with legal obligations. Local data on your device is retained until you delete the App data or the App itself.</p>

    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>We follow reasonable industry practices to protect information. Because no system is perfect, we cannot guarantee absolute security. If you share logs or reports with us, consider removing any sensitive content before sending.</p>

    <h2>8. Children</h2>
    <p>The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn we collected such information, we will take steps to delete it.</p>

    <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You may contact us to request access, correction, or deletion of personal information we maintain about you. We will respond according to applicable law.</p>

    <h2>10. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>If the information we collect is transferred to, stored, or processed in a country different from yours, we will take steps to ensure it is protected consistent with this policy.</p>

    <h2>11. App Store and Apple</h2>
    <p>The App uses Apple services and is distributed via the Mac App Store. Apple’s privacy policy and terms also apply to your use of the Mac App Store. We are independent from Apple and responsible for our App’s privacy practices.</p>

    <h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy. We will post the new Privacy Policy in the App or on our website and update the Effective Date above. Continued use of the App after changes indicates acceptance of the revised policy.</p>

    <h2>13. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have questions or concerns about this policy, contact us:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Email: <a href="mailto:hzrb1534@gmail.com">hzrb1534@gmail.com</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p class="muted">This privacy policy template is provided as a starting point. You should review it with legal counsel to ensure it meets all applicable laws and App Store requirements for your app and jurisdiction.</p>
